My goal for the artifact is a deployed webapp that has the following specifications:

 
1. The webapp is a learning activity to assist with memorizing the capital cities for states in the USA.

2. The function of the webapp is a matching exercise in which the user is presented with 10 random capital cities and must match them to their corresponding state.

3. After the activity, users are presented with a fact about each relevant state to help reinforce their memorization.

4. The speed and accuracy of the user during the assessment are compiled into a score.

5. User scores are stored on a Google Firebase backend, and visible from the webapp.
